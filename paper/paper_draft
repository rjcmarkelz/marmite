Ideas I want to get across:
Linking eQTL to pQTL
Linking eQTL to genome evolution
Linking eQTL to gene networks

In the recent evolutionary history of Brassica rapa there is thought to be a two genome duplication events. The first genome duplication event lead to one of the two genomes becoming slightly more dominant. Then there was another genome duplication event that lead to three subgenomes, defined by the residuals of transposons littering the genome. Over time, one of these three subgenomes, the most recent genome duplication event, became the dominant genome for gene expression. If this is true we wanted to explore the possibility that this subgenome is the one responsible for disproportionatly more cis-eqtl attributed to this subgenome. 

We wanted to explore the phenotypic consequences of the expression of these three subgenomes on agronomically and evolutionary important traits. 

Finally we asked whether it made sense to classify gene co-expression networks made out of each of these subgenomes into one large network to explain trait variance or into subnetworks that were more flexible in context specific situations (e.g. in different environments). This goes after the idea that gene duplication allows for more flexiblity in the system, then co-expression networks built solely out of one subgenome could be compared to networks built out of other subgenomes. The caveat here is the information contained within one subgenome. Network horse race? 

Cheng et al 2013 showed that there were definatively three karyotypes in the current brassica rapa subgenome. These were mapped onto the current genome sequence. I took that information and overlayed the eQTL data on top of it. The colors are awesome. When you bring together information that was in different places and make something new with it. This is the art side of science. When combining these pieces of information I found that there appears to be an overlap between the number of trans-eQTL and the least fractionated genome. This is interesting because it could mean that this genome is responsible for disproportionately more of the traits. So you may not need to work with the entire genome to make breeding progress. If you can find the regions that are the least repressed over evolutionary, or domestication then these are the ones that you should focus on breeding for. 

Evolution may have selected for entire genomes that were flexible in how they responded to the environment. There is more entropy in the system if there are three genomes. There are more ways to respond to the environment. Breeding plants to always grow consistantly across a range of environments is a challenge. If there is extra wobble in the system by having more axes of variation to, well, vary and be able to respond to whatever is thrown at the plants. They must interpret the environment and build this into some sort of framework of growth that is flexible to change. As humans we want to control the environment for the plants and maximize their growth given what we shown to be the optimal growth conditions for them. This works, but it is slow progress. Is there another way? We are limited by the physics of the system. Let us not forget that. Hybrid vigor is a manifestation of what I am trying to get across I think. Genes are mixed together and allow the plant to be flexible in how it deals with the given environment. 

The evolution of plants DNA sequence variation leading to differences in phenotypic traits important for plant growth. 

In many cases these DNA polymorphisms cause quantifiable differences in mRNA abundance that leads to quantifiable differences in protein abundance.
